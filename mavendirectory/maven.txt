maven:
     -Maven is one of the tool from devops which is used to build the code.
     -There are three repositories in maven:
                a) central repository
		b) remote repository
		c) local repository
DEPENDENCIES:
	-while executing or building the code, maven searches for dependencies in local repository, if they are not present in local repository then maven will automatically  download it from remote repository.
	-dependencies are kept on pom.xml file inside <dependencies> tag.
	
PLUGINS:
	-plugins are used to execute, compile and test the code with junits.
	-they are also used to create the jar files and in project documentation.

 The lifecyle of maven:
       1)clean
       2)compile
       3)packages
       4)insert
       5)deploy

 Pom.XML:
 	-All the information about the project is stored in pom.xml
	-whenever we execute the code maven first looks for the pom in current directory and read the pom.xml then executes the code.
